This repository contains the implementations for the course “Topics in Deep Learning” @ CMU (10-707). All the implementations are in python.

Assignment 1: Implement a multi-layer neural network with different activations and mini-batched data with batch normalisation.
Assignment 2: Implement a Restricted Boltzmann Machine and an Autoencoder and use them as pre-trainers for the input to the MLP.
Assignment 3: Build a 4-gram Neural Language Model and interpret the word vectors learnt from it.
