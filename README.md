# Topics in Deep Learning #

This repository contains the implementations for the course “Topics in Deep Learning” @ CMU (10-707). All the implementations are in python.

## Multi-Layer Perceptron: 
> Implement a multi-layer neural network with different activation funcations and mini-batched data with batch normalisation.
## Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and Autoencoder:
 > Implement a Restricted Boltzmann Machine and an Autoencoder and use them as pre-trainers for the input to the MLP.
## Neural Language Model: 
 > Build a 4-gram Neural Language Model and interpret the word vectors learnt from it.
